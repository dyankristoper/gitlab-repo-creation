# Gitlab Repo Creation

To be used for creating student's GitLab groups and repositories.

Goal is to place this within uplifted as part of batch setup flow.



For now, tweak `index.js` to your needs then run `node index.js`.

## How to use
1. Run `npm install`
2. Generate a GitLab [personal access token](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/profile/personal_access_tokens.html) with `api` scope.
3. Tweak `index.js` as needed, some sample uses/code blocks are available but commented out.
4. Run with `node index.js`
